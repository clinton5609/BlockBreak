# BlockBreak
Blockbreak is a 2d top down survival shooter game. The main goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible and beat your highest score. 
The player will experience waves of enemies which will be interrupted every 3 waves to have a chance at upgrades. Enemies will drop coins upon
death that the player can spend in the shop, every 3 waves. Each wave will increase the amount of enemies that the player must face, making survival
harder the longer the player survives. The difficulty can be alleviated by upgrading stats in the shop. To aid in survival, the player can place blocks.
The player must place these blocks with strategy however because they are limited to a maximum of 3 blocks to place at once. The blocks will fade over time
which means the player can't just hide in a corner forever. However, since these blocks are infinite with the only limitation being the number of blocks
placed at once, survival is possible.
